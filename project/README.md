## Single page application with ReactJS and Apollo

### AIM

##### To give better understanding how you can integrate Apollo with React and React router

### Description

**Authentication?** You will learn it. **Apollo Data?** Included. **Integration with React and React router?** Of course!

### What's left for you in this project?

- You can always improve user interface
- User cannot visit to our '/' and '/create/post' routes without authentication but user can visit '/login' even after authentication! You can fix it(for reference you can see the private route inside our project)
- For now user cannot see a particular post (what if user clicks on a particular post or wants to see all the information about a particular post ).You can create a new route something like '/post/:id' ....Need a query?already included! just checkout **schema.js**
- Do some enhancement by implementing **delete** and **edit** functionality
