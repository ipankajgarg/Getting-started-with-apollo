### What is apollo?

Apollo helps to connect your UI with the Graphql Server and manages the whole client side data in a single centralized object

### But what does that mean

- Connect your UI with the Graphql server :-
(** Graphql is a query language for an api so we need some sort of framework or library like Apollo which can talk to Graphql server in the form of query (Dont know what is query and how to write? Don't worry i will be telling you from the scratch))

//TODO diagram of difference between others(api fetching) and graphql with apollo


- Manages client side data in a single centralized object :-
(** Remember the problem when we are creating large application using React . Props are the only way to pass data from parent to child but what if we have deep nested child   )
