This repository is just about installing core packages and this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Packages 

- graphql
- react-apollo
- apollo-boost
- graphql-tag

 **let me explain one by one what these libraries are actually doing for us**

- **graphql-tag:** GraphQL queries are not a valid javascript so we need some library which parses our queries into a valid javascript

- **graphql:** It also parses GraphQL queries

- **react-apollo:** Its a wrapper or a layer for React.In simple words it connect react with apollo container

- **apollo-boost:** provide access of Apollo-client(where all magic happens).There are another ways to get started with apollo-client but this is the most easiest way which requires probably zero configuration



## wanna test out?
- **yarn**
- **yarn start**
